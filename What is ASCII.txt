What is ASCII?
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used widely in programming and computing. This standard consists of 128 symbols, where each symbol represents a specific character, symbol, or control command. 

Using ASCII in Programming:
1. *Text Handling:*
   - ASCII allows representation, storage, and manipulation of text in programs. For example, in C++, you can store a character and get its ASCII value:
         char letter = 'A';
     int ascii_value = (int) letter; // This will give you the value 65
     
2. *Encoding and Decoding:*
   - Programmers use ASCII to encode and decode texts, especially when transmitting data between different systems to ensure compatibility.

3. *Input and Output Operations:*
   - ASCII codes are used for text control and flow in input and output operations. For example:
         std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // Uses ASCII codes to display the text
     
4. *Calculations and Transformations:*
   - The numerical values of ASCII characters can be used for calculations or text transformations, such as converting lowercase letters to uppercase:
         char lower = 'a';
     char upper = lower - 32; // 'a' - 32 = 'A'
     Practical Example of Using ASCII:
Here's an example of how to print all uppercase and lowercase letters using their ASCII values in C++:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Print uppercase letters
    for (char c = 'A'; c <= 'Z'; ++c) {
        cout << c << " : " << (int)c << endl;
    }

    // Print lowercase letters
    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
        cout << c << " : " << (int)c << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
**Summary:**ASCII is fundamental for text encoding in programming, providing a standardized way to represent characters and symbols, which ensures compatibility and simplifies text handling and data exchange between different systems.
